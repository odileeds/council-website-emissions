# Data

We use the [Website Carbon Calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com/) to assess the CO2 emissions from local council websites. These are collated in [a Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/175kUjmGELkBXhVnF0f1IGnwe14TpKKkGnSYpqWyUpCo/edit#gid=0) and a static copy is saved here as [website-carbon.tsv](website-carbon.tsv). We have included Local Authorities and a selection of County Councils. Council websites were initially taken from the [Local Government Association](https://www.local.gov.uk/our-support/guidance-and-resources/communications-support/digital-councils/social-media/go-further/a-z-councils-online) (England & Wales), [COSLA](https://www.cosla.gov.uk/councils) (Scotland), and manual searching for Northern Ireland. The LGA data seem to be out-of-date in places with some broken links so some council websites have been updated by hand. For Welsh council websites that have a language-selection splash page, the Welsh language version of the home page has been chosen as the URL to test.
